      <h3>Rad</h3>
      <p>You know the dog at the park who runs around making friends and prances with confidence? That’s Radar!! He’s got personality through the roof! This little guy is 7 lbs and approx 4 months old. He’s got short legs and a fairly small stature. We have no clue what he’s mixed with since he’s a rescue. Could be shepherd mixed with a short leg breed of some kind. We don’t think he will grow to be over 25 lbs but we can never be sure since he was a stray. Radar is working on potty training, he’s great in the kennel, and he loves playing with other dogs. He’s very friendly and outgoing, and absolutely loves to play with toys and balls! He’s the perfect size for loading up and going on adventures. Inquire today to adopt Rad!</p>

      <h3>Stormee</h3>
      <p>My name is Storm! We think I am a lab/staffy mix around 4 months old and 27 lbs. I am being fostered with many other dogs of all sizes and I love to play with them. At my foster home I am practicing potty training and doing great with learning my house manners! I can be calm and sweet or I can be playful and active. I will be the perfect size for going on adventures with you. I am well socialized and can’t wait to give you hugs and kisses every day! If you have any questions about me please ask! I love to be pet and loved on. I am very sweet but I can also be playful!</p>

      <h3>Abby</h3>
      <p>Hi I'm Abby! I am sweet and I love to give kisses. I’m only 8 weeks old and approx 8 lbs. and I have puppy breath! I ended up in a shelter, with my mom and 5 siblings, when I was just 1 week old. Now, I am crashing at my foster family’s place, waiting on someone to adopt me. I go potty on my pee pads, and I promise I am working on being potty trained to go outside! If you are interested in adopting me please contact the rescue that saved me from the shelter!</p>
